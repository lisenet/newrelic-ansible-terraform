### Usage

You must obtain New Relic's licence key to use the `newrelic.newrelic-infra` Ansible role.

The licence key should be stored in the file `group_vars/nri-agents`. You can use Ansible vault to encrypt it.

Edit the file [`inventory`](./inventory) and add hosts that you want the New Relic's infrastructure agent installed on.

Deploy:

```
ansible-playbook configure-newrelic.yml
```
